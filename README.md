==========================================

Some browsing and some lusting has led to the following. Santa, do you have an account??

  - [Birdy plates](http://www.magpieline.com/product/87/birdy-plates.html)  
    Love these. So simple and fun
  - [Anaise Woolf print](http://www.anaiswoolf.com/my-most-perfect-place-135-p.asp)  
    Love everything about this print. The colours are wonderful, but the words are just the best
  - [Pack of three socks](http://www.giftgenies.com/presents/pair-and-a-spare-socks)  
    Two for you, one for the washing machine monster. That's maths
  - [Uplifting canvas bag](http://www.everythingbegins.com/you-look-lovely-today-tote-bag.html)  
    A complement for the wearer and the passer-by
  - [Sew a robin](http://downthatlittlelane.com.au/maggies-place/product/12291-robin-sewing-kit)  
    For idle hands at Christmas
  - [Whale tree decoration](http://www.montysvintageshop.co.uk/victorian-whale-christmas-decoration.html)  
    This just makes me smile. Would totally make houseroom for this all year round
  - [Stacked craft tins](http://www.next.co.uk/g482598s1)  
    Compact and cute. Makes a nice alternative to a standard sewing box
  - [Industrial vice bookends](http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/theorchard/product/vintage-vice-bookends)  
    Would my sister like these? Hrm.
  - [I like big books and I cannot lie](http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/mrteacup/product/i-like-big-books-and-i-cannot-lie-mug)  
    Again, smile-worthy
  - [It's a balloon animal, but it's jelly!](http://www.justmustard.com/product-109/party-pooch-jelly-mould/)  
    If I ever made jelly, I'd want it to look like this
  - [PRETTY tea caddy](http://www.alisonappleton.com/#!store/vstc4=darcy)  
    Not sure it would be big enough for the amount of tea we get through, but how very very pretty
  - [Pestle and mortar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blacksmith-Forged-Rustic-Pestle-Mortar/dp/B007Z0CBZ0)  
    I happen to have the world's best pestle and mortar. But this is surely the second best
  - [Utensils jar](http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/graciecollins/product/sticks-storage-jar)  
    For bits and bobs and sticks
